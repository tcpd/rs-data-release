The Rajya Sabha Dataset is a corpus of data concerning all members of the Rajya Sabha of India from March 1952 - 20 July 2022. The data comes from the Rajya Sabha website (https://rajyasabha.nic.in/) and Rajya Sabha Who's Who. This official website contains information about membersâ€™ political history, positions held, sociological information etc. The Who's Who is a periodic publication released by the Upper House detailing information on its constituent members.

TCPD has first extracted this information and then cleaned and structured it to fit into a tabular format. 

The "Type" variable in the dataset describes the status of membership as on 20-July-2022, either as current or former.
