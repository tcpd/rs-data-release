The Rajya Sabha Dataset is a corpus of data concerning all members of the Rajya Sabha of India from March 1952 - September 2021. The data comes from the Rajya Sabha website (https://rajyasabha.nic.in/). This official website contains information about membersâ€™ political history, positions held, sociological information etc. TCPD has first extracted this information and then cleaned and structured it to fit into a tabular format. 

The "Type" variable in the dataset describes the status of membership as on 14-Oct-2021, either as current or former.
The "pid" variable is consistent with the TCPD-IID and TCPD-IED.

This repository is an extract of the comprehensive tpcd-data repository at "tcpd-data/RS_Data_Raw_Incumbency" directory.
